AxiScan is a repository of tools for implementing a likelihood framework for axion direct detection experiments. It is designed to replace traditional signal to noise based estimates, as shown in the figure above. If this code helps contribute to published work, please cite the original reference [1711.0xxxx](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.0xxxx).
